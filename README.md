# Mobile-Webshop
A React Native mobile webshop. Color ratio and reading accessibility was also considered during the development. The aim of the project
was to learn the basic and some advanced features of mobile app development. In addition to development, I also tried to make use of some
UI/UX principles, like color ratio, reading accessibility through color contrast, button size, etc.
